‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE** This project's `major` semver matches the supported Expo SDK version. This helps spot inconsistencies between your Expo SDK and this plugin, as well as ensuring any changes to the upstream config-plugins system are properly addressed.

# 46.x.x (Expo SDK 46)

### 46.0.0

##### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

- Requires Expo SDK 46, which is now actively checked using [`semver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) against the config's SDK version. In React Native 0.68+, the `AppDelegate` files are all objective-c++, and there is no `withAppDelegate` support for swift files. The Semver check avoids a footgun of running this plugin with SDK 45 and swift `AppDelegate` files and ending up with non-functional flipper.

**Migration** Please upgrade to the latest Expo SDK. `expo-community-flipper` only maintains versions that are compatible with the supported Expo SDK versions.

##### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes

- Modifies `AppDelegate.mm` to enable `RCTAppSetupUtils` per [flipper manual setup](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native-ios/#react-native-068)
