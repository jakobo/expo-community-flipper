⚠️ **NOTE** This project's `major` semver matches the supported Expo SDK version. This helps spot inconsistencies between your Expo SDK and this plugin, as well as ensuring any changes to the upstream config-plugins system are properly addressed.

# 47.x.x (Expo SDK 47)

### 47.0.1

##### 🛠️ Fixes

- Added support for the default `NO_FLIPPER` emerging standard c6e0732
- Added support for all profiles, possibly related to a regression where react-native would attempt to bundle a non-linked flipper resulting in a symbole error `_OBJC_CLASS_$_FlipperClient` c6e0732

### 47.0.0

Release for compatibility with SDK 47.

# 46.x.x (Expo SDK 46)

### 46.0.2

##### 🛠️ Fixes

- Added the ability to explicitly enable/disable flipper on a per platform level [ref](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper/commit/8c5d5f747862f7bd86093bd72d561d6bee0aa199)
- Added the ability to strip `use_frameworks` on iOS [ref](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper/commit/8c5d5f747862f7bd86093bd72d561d6bee0aa199)

##### 🧹 Chores

- Adds all-contributors. Thank you to every single person who's helped make expo-community-flipper awesome ❤️

### 46.0.1

**Migration** If you were using individual pod specifications (folly, etc), you can remove all of that now. The Flipper team recommends using only the Flipper version, relying on the pod and maven to pull down the necessary dependencies.

##### 🛠️ Fixes

- Fixes a breaking issue with Podfile generation introduced in react-native 0.69.2 [ref](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper/pull/20)
  - Removes the legacy `use_flipper` declaration
  - Removes the `post_install` flipper code
  - Removes the `AppDelegate` code as the RCTAppSetupUtils already exist and this was redundant [ref](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/d6b89ab435b534bb9bb560d0c1bb15bb0abdfcfa/templates/expo-template-bare-minimum/ios/HelloWorld/AppDelegate.mm#L9)
- Removes individual pod configs as those are no longer encouraged by the FB Flipper Team
- Removed old SDK tests

### 46.0.0

##### 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

- Requires Expo SDK 46, which is now actively checked using [`semver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) against the config's SDK version. In React Native 0.68+, the `AppDelegate` files are all objective-c++, and there is no `withAppDelegate` support for swift files. The Semver check avoids a footgun of running this plugin with SDK 45 and swift `AppDelegate` files and ending up with non-functional flipper.

**Migration** Please upgrade to the latest Expo SDK. `expo-community-flipper` only maintains versions that are compatible with the supported Expo SDK versions.

##### 🛠️ Fixes

- Modifies `AppDelegate.mm` to enable `RCTAppSetupUtils` per [flipper manual setup](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native-ios/#react-native-068)
